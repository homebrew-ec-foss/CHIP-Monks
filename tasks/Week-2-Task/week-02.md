# Week 02 – CHIP-8 CPU (Simulation-Only)

>[!NOTE]
> **DO NOT edit this file directly.** Just copy this file into your `todo/` folder. Follow the same instructions from previous week.

## Part A – Understand the ISA

| Step | Task                                              | Resource                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Read Cowgod’s CHIP-8 Technical Reference        | [Cowgod's CHIP-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)|
| 2    | Skim the opcode layout                            | `docs/Chip8-Docs/CHIP8-Opcode-Table.pdf`   |
| 3    | Understand the meaning of `Vx`, `Vy`, `I`, and PC | see Cowgod Section 2                 |
| 4    | Understand fetch-decode-execute model             | `docs/Verilog-Docs/FSM-Explanation.md     |

## Part B – Implement the CPU

You will build a `chip8_cpu.v` module that:

- Fetches 2 bytes from memory
- Decodes the 16-bit opcode
- Executes basic instructions using FSM logic

### Recommended Opcodes (Phase 1)

Try implementing the following in this order:

|Opcode|Meaning|Action Required|
|---|---|---|
|6XNN|`Vx <- NN`|Load constant into register|
|7XNN|`Vx <- Vx + NN`|Add constant to register|
|1NNN|`PC <- NNN`|Unconditional jump|
|3XNN|`if Vx == NN, skip next`|Conditional skip|
|4XNN|`if Vx != NN, skip next`|Conditional skip|
|ANNN|`I <- NNN`|Set index register|

Later we will expand the Instruction Set Architecture. Check out [Project-Explanation](./project-explanation.md) for detailed info :D

- [ ] Reviewed the full ISA table

## Part B – Design and Simulate

- [ ] Created `chip8_cpu.v` FSM scaffold
- [ ] Implemented `6XNN`, `7XNN`, and `1NNN`
- [ ] Implemented skip instructions (`3XNN`, `4XNN`)
- [ ] Tested opcodes manually (waveform or display-based)
- [ ] Created a testbench in `chip8/tb/` 
- [ ] Added a `README.md` with good explanation (upto you how you want it)

## Some Workflow Tips

> [!NOTE]
> Always pull first
> ```bash
> git pull --rebase
> ```   

1. Work only inside `mentee-<yourname>/`.
2. Treat `tasks/` as read‑only—copy files, don’t edit them.
3. Keep commit messages short like this `commit-type: commit-message @github-user-name` but include the week if possible.
