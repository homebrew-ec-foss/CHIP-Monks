# Week 03 – CHIP-8 CPU Finalization (Simulation-Only)

>[!NOTE]
> **DO NOT edit this file directly.** Just copy this file into your `todo/` folder. Follow the same instructions from previous weeks.

## Goal for the Week

Your goal this week is simple: **complete the remaining opcodes**, **stabilize the FSM**, and **polish your testbench and README**. This wraps up the core CPU implementation.

---

## Part A – Complete the ISA

Refer to the full CHIP-8 instruction set and implement any instructions that's pending from Week 02.

- Start from your existing FSM.
- Make sure each opcode is correctly decoded and updates the PC/state accordingly.
- Test your logic with realistic programs (you can use ROMs if needed).
- Confirm that the display and keyboard interactions (if attempted) are stubbed or commented if not functional.

>[!TIP]
> Your `chip8_cpu.v` should now handle **all basic opcodes** in the ISA, including:
> - Conditional skips
> - Arithmetic/logical ops
> - Memory-register transfer
> - Control flow (`CALL`, `RET`, `JP`, `SE`, etc.)
> - Drawing (`DXYN`) and timers (can be stubbed if needed)

---

## Part B – Polish and Wrap Up

Once your CPU logic is complete:

- Clean up your FSM and state transitions
- Add clear comments explaining each opcode
- Document your design choices and limitations
- Refactor messy code blocks

## Required Folder Layout (same as before)

## Personal Checklist _(copy into your own file and tick)_

```markdown
# Week 03 Checklist – <your name>

## Final CPU Implementation

- [ ] Completed all remaining opcodes
- [ ] Verified correct PC and state updates for each opcode
- [ ] Cleaned up `chip8_cpu.v` with comments and structure
- [ ] Waveform-tested all CHIP-8 instructions

- [ ] Updated `README.md` with full opcode coverage + notes
```

## Some Workflow Tips

> [!NOTE]
> Always pull first
> ```bash
> git pull --rebase
> ```   

1. Work only inside `mentee-<yourname>/`.
2. Treat `tasks/` as read‑only—copy files, don’t edit them.
3. Keep commit messages short like this `commit-type: commit-message @github-user-name` but include the week if possible.
