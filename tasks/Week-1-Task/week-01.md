# Week 01 – Introduction to Verilog & Mini‑System Build  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mentees — DO NOT edit this file directly.**
> 
> 1. First, create a `todo/` folder inside your own mentee folder:
>    ```bash
>    mkdir -p mentee-<yourname>/todo
>    ```
> 2. Then, copy this file into it:
>    ```bash
>    cp tasks/Week-1-Task/week-01.md mentee-<yourname>/todo/week-01.md
>    ```
> 3. Tick checkboxes **only in your copy** so we never clash in Git.

## Part A – Learn the Language

| Step | Task | Resource path in repo | 
|------|------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Read **ChipVerify Verilog Guide** up to **Section 6 – RTL Simulation** | `docs/Verilog-Docs/README.md` | 
| 2 | For each new concept, solve a matching exercise on **HDLBits** and run the sim | `docs/Verilog-Docs/README.md`  | 
| 3 | Skim the quick‑reference PDFs whenever you’re stuck | `docs/Verilog-Docs/` |

>[!TIP] 
> Keep HDLBits open in another tab—immediate practice cements the reading.

## Part B – Build Your Own Tiny Digital System

Pick **exactly one** project below.  
Each has three blocks—**Easy → Medium → Hard**. Build them in order, then hook them up in `system.v`.  
**Bonus** - Write a **minimal testbench** `system_tb.v` that proves it works.

| # | Project | Easy 🟢 | Medium 🟡 | Hard 🔴 |
|---|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **Mini Calculator Core** | 2‑to‑1 mux (8‑bit) | 2‑reg register file (1‑port write) | 3‑bit ALU (`ADD, SUB, AND, XOR`) + opcode decoder |
| 2 | **LED Pattern Blinker** | Pattern ROM (3–4 hard‑coded 8‑bit patterns) | Counter that asserts `next_pattern` every N cycles | FSM that cycles patterns & drives `led[7:0]` |
| 3 | **Binary‑to‑7‑Seg Display** | 4‑bit → 7‑seg hex decoder | Up‑counter 0→F every second | *Optional stretch:* 2‑digit multiplex driver |
| 4 | **Traffic Light Controller** | One‑hot 3‑bit decoder | Timer with preset value & enable/reset | FSM cycling NS/EW lights: Green → Yellow → Red (uses timer) |

## Required Folder Layout (per mentee)

```
mentee-<name>/
├── todo/
│ └── week-01.md # ← your personal checklist(this one copied)
├── system-project/
│ ├── system.v # top-level wiring
│ ├── system_tb.v # simple testbench
│ └── README.md # block diagram + quick notes if possible
└── reports/ #all your learnings of every week go here
```

## Some Workflow Tips

> [!NOTE]
> Always pull first
> ```bash
> git pull --rebase
> ```   

1. Work only inside `mentee-<yourname>/`.
2. Treat `tasks/` as read‑only—copy files, don’t edit them.
3. Keep commit messages short like this `commit-type: commit-message @github-user-name` but include the week if possible.
